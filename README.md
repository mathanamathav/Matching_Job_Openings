# Match-Maker-For-Jobs (societe generale hackathon 2023)

### Problem Statement: Participants will be tasked with two pivotal objectives:
- [X] Skill Database Creation: Participants are required to create a comprehensive database that contains various skill sets along with their corresponding matching job openings. A sample skill database will be provided to you as an attachment for reference. You are expected to expand and refine this database to cover a wide range of skills and job roles.
- [X] Automatic Job Matching: Your task is to build a platform that takes a userâ€™s skill set as input and identifies the most relevant job openings based on the skills provided. This platform should utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze the skill database and make accurate job recommendations.
- [X] The application needs to possess a functional user interface.
- [X] Possible ideas to extend this idea
